* Provide intelligent super genre classification for music organization
* Enable DJs to quickly identify tracks they need to acquire for their local collection
* Deliver a free, accessible tool for the music community

### **1.3 Success Metrics**

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Genre Classification Accuracy | >90% of tracks correctly mapped to super genres | User feedback and override rate |
| Missing Tracks Identified | 100% of gaps accurately detected | Comparison validation testing |
| User Engagement | Users complete full library sync | Sync completion tracking |
| Return Usage | 70% return within 30 days to re-sync | User session tracking |

* User's track genre assignments in `spotify_liked.super_genre` column
* Normalized field parsing logic (primary_artist, core_title, featured_artists, mix)
* Sync progress and resumability infrastructure

1. Be additive only (no breaking changes to existing columns)
2. Maintain backward compatibility with existing data
3. Preserve all user-assigned genre mappings and overrides
4. Not require data migration that could lose genre assignments
